# Preview image in templateOne (2025-07-06 13:44Z)

_**User**_

In templateOne I want to preview the img of it. Currently you just preview the place of the img not the img. Fix it

I'll help you fix the image preview in templateOne. Let me first explore the codebase to understand how the template preview is currently implemented and where the image preview issue is occurring.

Read file: src/components/TemplateModal.tsx

Now I can see the issue! In the `TemplateModal.tsx` file, the template preview is being displayed as text content instead of an actual image. Looking at line 119, the preview is rendered as:

```tsx
<div className="text-white text-6xl font-bold opacity-20">
  {template.preview}
</div>
```

For templateOne, `template.preview` is set to the imported image (`img`), but it's being treated as text content instead of being rendered as an `<img>` element. Let me fix this by updating the preview rendering logic to properly display images when the preview is an image source.

Perfect! I've fixed the image preview issue in the template modal. Here's what I changed:

1. **Added conditional rendering**: The code now checks if the preview is a string that starts with 'ðŸŽ¨' (for the custom portfolio template) or if it's an image source.

2. **Proper image rendering**: For templateOne (and any other templates with actual image sources), it now renders an `<img>` element with:
   - `src={template.preview}` - uses the imported image
   - `alt={`${template.name} preview`}` - provides proper accessibility
   - `className="w-full h-full object-cover"` - ensures the image covers the entire preview area properly

3. **Maintained existing functionality**: The custom portfolio template still shows the emoji as before.

Now when you open the template modal, templateOne will display the actual preview image (`templateOnePreview.png`) instead of just showing the image path as text. The image will be properly sized and cover the entire preview area with the overlay effect maintained.
